# Credit Card Fraud Guided Project

In this guided project by Karina Data Scientist, I built a fraud detection model using a Random Forest Classifier. I practiced data preprocessing, feature scaling, cross-validation (F1 score), and evaluated performance using a confusion matrix, feature importance, and ROC-AUC curves. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of the machine learning workflow and how to detect anomalies in imbalanced datasets using Python.
